 * Implement the sample-based motif finding algorithm. 
 * Your program should take as input a set of sequences and

 * with the smallest total number of mismatches to all sequences. 
 * Your program should also report the total number of mismatches, 
 * the matched subsequences and locations on each sequence, and the 
 * amount of wall-clock time taken by your program to find the consensus.
